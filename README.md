# Project description
 SOEN 342 group project.  
 
# Tasty Foodz delivery app
A food delivery application aiming to improve modern food delivery. Offering improved UI, a way to help you overcome choice anxiety, let you quote businesses for custom products, and always aiming to include new businesses.

# Objective
In the market, many customers today are overwhelmed with the amount of choices available to them. Our main objective is to help customers' indecisiveness, by making the choice for them, using a binary game they can play. Another issues on the market at the moment, is the overbearance of large chains in food delivery apps. Corporations have large budgets to spend on larger banners, ads and other ways of attracting attention but small businesses take longer to join apps. We would like to simplify the application process, as well as invite new businesses actively to help them enter our market  faster and more consistently. By also allowing for direct messaging bewteen customers and businesses, we would like to include custom businesses such as cake makers who need to speak to their clients to know what they want.
